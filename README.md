# File sorter
it's very common to put a lot of files on desktop because we need it quickly but after a time we will need to sort these files to make our desktop be clear. that's why I created a dummy script which would help users to sort files.

## Version 0.0.1
- Users need to move script to the folder which they want to sort
- Currently script only works by being executed by shell
- script create folders Documents, Images, videos, xls and music
- do not sort files with more than extension point in filename.

## Requiriments
- Python3 installed on your system 
- Windows OS

## Note
All you have to know that this is a primitive version of what I plan to do. I hope you can wait until a more universal and user friendly versi√≥n. while I would thank you if you give me more ideas for improving script performance.
